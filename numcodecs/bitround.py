    Drops a specified number of bits from the floating point mantissa,
    leaving an array more amenable to compression. The number of bits to keep should
    be determined by an information analysis of the data to be compressed.
    The approach is based on the paper by Kl√∂wer et al. 2021
    (https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-021-00156-2). See

        depends on the dtype input data. If keepbits is

        to no transform.
